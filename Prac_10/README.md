#Reflection
Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? What did you learn from doing the estimates?
At first my accuracy was generaly poor but as the course progressed i covered the gaps and adjusted and estimates are good. this i have accomplished by understanding the subject and improving on my pace.
Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
i have not gotten the chance to review anyone's code because my patterners requests have not been working. but being reviewed has helped me learn from others and grasp concepts i have not understood or missed out during the lesson.
Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
probably i would change feedback and collaboration.
